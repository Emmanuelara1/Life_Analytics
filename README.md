# Human Genome Project - Advanced Analytics Website

## Overview

The Human Genome Project (HGP) is one of the greatest scientific feats in history. This website aims to explore genomic data and life analytics based on the human genome. The project adheres to international standards set by health organizations like the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Japan's Genome Research Institute.

## Features

### 1. **Home Page**
   - Overview of the Human Genome Project.
   - Introduction to genomic analytics and life analytics.
   - Links to explore advanced tools and algorithms.

### 2. **Genomic Data Analytics Page**
   - Advanced tools for analyzing genomic data.
   - Visualizations using D3.js and other libraries.
   - Allows users to interact with genomic data for analysis.

### 3. **Life Analytics Page**
   - Predictive health analysis based on genomic data.
   - Upload your genomic dataset to receive predictions (e.g., disease predispositions).
   - Follows international standards for health analytics used by NIH and Japan's Genome Research Institute.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building the interactive user interface.
- **D3.js**: For creating data visualizations.
- **React Router**: For navigation between pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the pages with a blue, white, and purple theme.
- **JavaScript**: For handling logic, including data uploads and predictions.
