# Life Analytics - Advanced Bio Image Analysis

This project demonstrates the use of Python, Flask, and TensorFlow for advanced bio-image analysis. The application processes uploaded bio-images using advanced image preprocessing, segmentation, and classification techniques. It also integrates a pre-trained machine learning model for feature detection in the images.

## Features

- **Image Preprocessing**: Advanced techniques such as bilateral filtering and Otsu's thresholding for noise reduction and enhancement.
- **Image Segmentation**: Segmentation using adaptive thresholding and morphological operations.
- **Machine Learning**: Integration with TensorFlow to classify bio-images using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- **User Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for secure access and image upload.
- **Interactive Image Visualization**: Plotly.js for zoomable and interactive images.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.6+**
- **Virtual Environment** (Recommended)

### Dependencies

- Flask
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Image
- SciPy
- Plotly
- PyJWT
